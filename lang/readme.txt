If you are interested in translating seo-stats-widget, use seo-stats-widget.pot as a template to create a po file for the new translation file.

The resulting translated file should be named with the following format:
- seo-stats-widget-
- ISO 639 language code (lowercase)
- an underscore
- ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (uppercase) 
- .mo

So for an Italian translation, the file name would be seo-stats-widget-it_IT.mo

Please *do not* translate URL's or placeholders, such as %s.

I can no longer maintain the translations, so please place the file on your site or somewhere online and send me an email (er.sunny.verma@gmail.com) with the location of the file. You can also leave a comment on my plugin support page with the same information.

Thanks!
